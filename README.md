# Backbone Form Validation
## Simple client side form validation using Backbone Models, Views and a form Collection.

Validation criteria is defined on the model, and the element's attributes. Validation errors are appended to the form input element.

Documentation and examples to be done soon.

Testing done with Mocha, Sinon and Chai.
